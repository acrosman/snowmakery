# Snowmakery - Recipe Editor for Snowfakery

[Snowfakery](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Snowfakery) is a tool for generatoring relational data sets. It was created by the Salesforce.org team as [a partial response to a need for better test data](https://www.attain.com/blog/salesforce-open-source-commons) for Salesforce projects. Snowfakery is great, but creating recipe files is a bit hard when you are first learning. This project is meant to help bridge that gap, while experts will probably want to handcraft the files [until better tools come around](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit), this will hopefully help people understand the options as they are getting started.

Snowfakery does not require Salesforce at all, it's a totally free-standing data generator capable to produce large amounts of carefully shaped data quickly. Sno

## requirements

npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that you’re sharing, so you can build amazing things.

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

## Running

Currently this project is in the very initial stages of development and is not fully functional – please feel free to contribute if you think it would be useful. It does not currently have an app builder setup (although that may change).

### Setup

1. Clone this repo, or your own fork.
2. Run `npm i` from the project root.

Once NPM has installed all the required packages run `npm start` to load the project.  There is a simple sample Snowfakery recipe in the sample_data directory.

Pull requests and other contributions welcome.
