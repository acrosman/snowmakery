# Snowmakery - Recipe Editor for Snowfakery

[Snowfakery](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Snowfakery) is a tool for generatoring relational data sets. It was created by the Salesforce.org team as [a partial response to a need for better test data](https://www.attain.com/blog/salesforce-open-source-commons) for Salesforce projects. Snowfakery is great, but creating recipe files is a bit hard when you are first learning.

This project is meant to help bridge that gap, while experts will probably want to handcraft the files [until better tools come around](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit), this will hopefully help people understand the options as they are getting started.

Snowfakery does not require Salesforce at all, it's a totally free-standing data generator capable to produce large amounts of carefully shaped data quickly. Snowmakery a free-standing Electron app that is simple meant to generate files for Snowfakery.
